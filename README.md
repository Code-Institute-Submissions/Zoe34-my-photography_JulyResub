The website is suited to large screens from a width of 1200px, medium screens from 735px, medium to small screens from 620px and very small devices from 576px.
The content is adjusted using different queries to maintain proportions with varying screen size and keep the content easy to read.

The errors that I have come across are an empty heading in the section element in the index.html and an empty heading in the logo class in in the header section. The main heading element is a camera symbol which is simple and related to the theme of the website.
