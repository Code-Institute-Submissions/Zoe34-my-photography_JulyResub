## Testing

### Code Validation:

- No errors were found when passing the code through the Jigsaw Validator.
- No errors were found on any page when testing the code using W3C Validator.
- W3C was used and the link https://zoe34.github.io/my-photography/ was pasted into the Address bar. No errors or warnings showed.
- The screen responsiveness for different screen sizes was tested using Chrome developer tools.

### Fixed bugs:

- The errors that I have come across are an empty heading in the section element in the index.html 
- An empty heading in the logo class in in the header section. - All errors have been successfully fixed. 
- Another bug was horizontal scrolling when using the main page and the gallery page on mobile screen mode. This has been resolved using "overflow: hidden;".

### Test Cases:

- As a new user I accessed the main page by pressing "Menu". The menu button lights up pink when hovered over and becomes underlined when clicked to confirm which page I am currently on.
